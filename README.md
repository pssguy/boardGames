# boardGames

This is a shinyApp in which various criteria can be set to find the best board game to play or purchase

It came out of [analyses I did](https://github.com/pssguy/fivethirtynine/tree/master/boardGames) recreating a 538 article
based on [boardgamegeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/) data, current as of May 2014

It can be run in R runGitHub("pssguy/boardGames") and I plan to publish as part of a website in due course
